# Unfelde Records



Unfelde Records is a Underground Minimal/Techno record label that releases underground electronic music in both digital and Vinyl-Only format for a niched public.
I aim to present our brand and what it stands for, our releases with links to sites and a gallery from events we had, alongside with contact details  and reviews.
Also there will be a **Send Demos** page where the visitor will be able to send us their work for a possible release with us.

### User Goals
1. Hear new music released.
2. Be up to date with our catalogue.
3. Be able to send demos for a posible release.
4. Obtain contact info.
5. Contact us with equiries trough the form.

### User Stories
1. As a radio dj I'm always looking for fresh new music that's easy to reach.
2. As a new producer, looking for a place to sign with, I want to send demos easy and fast.
3. As a first time user I want to find out more about the Record Label.
4. As a first time user I want to find contact information about the record label.
5. As a first time user I want to check their Social media pages.
6. As a first time user and a fan of the musical genre, I want to see cool photos from the events and festivals.
7. As a site owner, I want users to be able to contact us easily with queries or feedback.

### Site Owner Goals
1. To have all the information easy to reach.
2. To have an attractive and easy to use site.
3. To have a site that is responsive on all devices and easy to navigate.
4. To recieve as many demos as possible , with the related info needed as well.

### Design Choices
* The goal for this site was to create a simple and easy to use platform, that has also the "underground vibe" that is characteristic to the musical genre.

### Colors
Main colors are **Black** / **Grey** and **Dark Orange**. Most of the website is **Black** and **Grey** to give the feeling of something minimalistic, simple and dark, like the club sound that we are promoting, the **Dark Orange** color is used in the Navbar and Footer and ads a nice touch to the minimalist vibe that we aimed to create.

### Fonts
I have used Ubuntu as the font for the whole website. Clean and easy to read.

### Structure
In the upper part there's a navigation menu, which contains the name of the record label "Unfelde Records" in the left side , then in the middle section whe have 4 pages "Gallery, Releases, Reviews and Contact" and in the right side we have a button "Send Demos" that opens up a modal.
On the index page, we have **Our Story**, with some information about what we are and what we are doing, and underneath there's a carousel with photos from festivals and events.
Then The **Gallery** page, displays a whole page of images from different places where our music is used and enjoyed...and made :)
Next there's the **Releases** page that showcases our **Digital** and **Vinyl-Only** releases with cards that send you directly to the webistes whre you can buy the music from.
**Reviews** page is filled with some reviews fomr the industry leading names alongside with some nice, enjoyable clips.
Then we have our **Contact** page where you will find a form for sending us enquiries and questions you may have, there's also contact infomation and a map that pinpoints to our headquarters.
**Send Demos** is a modal that can be accesed from all the pages, which contains our logo and a form which is designed for the producers that want to send us demos for a chance to get to release their music with us.

### Testing

#### HTML Validation

I used [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the HTML code. All the pages pass with 0 errors.

Results here: [Index](https://github.com/robertdavid1205/CI_MS1_Unfelde_Records/blob/master/docs/validation/index-html-check.jpg)
              [Gallery](https://github.com/robertdavid1205/CI_MS1_Unfelde_Records/blob/master/docs/validation/gallery-html-check.jpg)
              [Releases](https://github.com/robertdavid1205/CI_MS1_Unfelde_Records/blob/master/docs/validation/releases-html-check.jpg)
              [Reviews](https://github.com/robertdavid1205/CI_MS1_Unfelde_Records/blob/master/docs/validation/reviews-html-check.jpg)
              [Contact Us](https://github.com/robertdavid1205/CI_MS1_Unfelde_Records/blob/master/docs/validation/contact-html-check.jpg)
              
#### CSS Validation

I used [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate the CSS code. All the pages pass with 0 errors.

Result here: [CSS](https://github.com/robertdavid1205/CI_MS1_Unfelde_Records/blob/master/docs/validation/css-check.jpg)

#### Accesibility

I used [WAVE WebAIM evaluation tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) to check the website's accesibility standards. All the pages have 4 errors.
* the errors come from 4 empty links from the icons in the footer. I have consulted with a tutor regarding this issue, and he asked me if the validator showed any erros.
  The validator didn't show any errors so he told me that:
  "I've never seen W3 mention that issue before and textless <a> tags are quite common these days. In that case, you'll be absolutely fine with your icons alone"  and "If it    doesn't appear in the W3 validator then it won't affect anything,"
