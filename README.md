### User Stories
* As a radio dj I'm always looking for fresh new music, something that not many have, these guys are exactly what I'm looking for with every release the have.
* As a new producer I very often being rejected by the big labels, most of the time they don't even listen to my work, Unfelde Records is that label that always listens to what I send them and they even give feedback so I can get better at what I'm doing.
* As an established producer, I want my music to be heard by as many people as possible, and I want to know details about whoever releases my music, so I can be sure that our paths intersect. Their website offers me all the info I need and quick acces to their social media as well.
* As an underground electronic music pasionate, I want to have cool new and inedit music to "brag" to my friends with, and here I always find quality stuff.

### Site Owner Goals
1. To have all the information easy to reach.
2. To have an attractive and easy to use site.
3. To have a site that is responsive on all devices and easy to navigate.
4. To recieve as many demos as possible , with the related info needed as well.

### Design Choices
* The goal for this site was to create a simple and easy to use platform, that has also the "underground vibe" that is characteristic to the musical genre.

### Colors
Main colors are **Red** / **Brown** and **Grey**. Most of the website is **Brown** and **Red** to give the feeling of something dark, like the club rooms, the **Red** text reminds you of the red neons from the clubs and venues. **Grey** is the least used color, just to give a bit of contrast here and there. 

### Fonts
I have used Ubuntu as the font for the whole website. Clean and easy to read.

### Structure
In the upper part there's a navigation menu, which contains the name of the record label "Unfelde Records" in the left side , then in the middle section whe have 4 pages "Gallery, Releases, Reviews and Contact" and in the right side we have a button "Send Demos" that opens up a modal.
